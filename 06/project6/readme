README - This file.
HackAssembler - My code for the assembler interpretation. I chose to use Python as my high-level programing language in this project because
of the advantages of Python as a string manipulator and editing abilities. I have four methods in the the file: Main - runs the methos in the correct order. Parser - gets the file text and removes spaces, \n's, \t's, \r's, and comments. SymbolTable - Add symbols that symbols jump or variables for further use. And a Code method - that translates the parsed text to a binary code according to a built in dictionary that translates the asm commands to a binary hack commands. The code is easy to understand, and short.
